Go for CD Interface
===================


This is a simple django project that allows pipeline execution and pipeline
feedback stats.

The idea is not to replace Go for CDs GUI interface but to allow different
features and control.


Local development
-----------------

For convenience there is a vagrant box.

Run:

  cd vagrant

  cp Vagrantfile.sample Vagrantfile

  vagrant up
